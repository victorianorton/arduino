There are two scripts to control camera, LED light, and solenoid during habituation experiment.  

In the first script there are 30 total pulses.  The first 15 pulses will simulatenously turn on camera, LED light, and solenoid (trigger stimulus) - for one second. Next 15 pulses (16-30) will simulatenously turn on LED light and solenoid - for one second.  

In the second script there are 45 total pulses. First 30 pulses will simulatenously turn on LED light, and solenoid (trigger stimulus) - for one second. Next 15 pulses (16-30) will simulatenously turn on camera, LED light, and solenoid - for one second.
